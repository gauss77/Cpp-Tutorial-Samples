# C++ Tutorial Samples 2017

This repository contains C++ sample codes that I collected from cplusplus.com with standard C++ 14. you can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used with samples.

To access or contribute the most recent modifications of these samples, find their github repository here: <https://github.com/mahdimotamedi/Cpp-Tutorial-Samples-2017> 

## Running the Samples

I ran all samples with **Visual Studio 2015** on Windows. I think it work with a lot of compilers. please report me the problems with other compilers.
