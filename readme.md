# C++ Tutorial Samples 2017

This repository contains C++ sample codes that I adopted from cplusplus.com with standard C++ 14. Also they can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used.

To access or contribute the most recent modifications of these samples, find their github repository here: <https://github.com/mahdimotamedi/Cpp-Tutorial-Samples-2017> 

## Running the Samples

I ran all samples with `Visual Studio 2015` in Windows. I think it work with all compilers. please report me the problems with other compilers.

## References

I started learning this language with Deitels book. but if you know about c++ a few. i think you can learn it faster from cplusplus.com
